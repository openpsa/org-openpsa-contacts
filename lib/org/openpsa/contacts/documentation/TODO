org.openpsa.contacts TODO
=========================

## Duplicate finder

* refactor to operate in small chunks (less efficient but also less prone
to crashing)

## Semantic web

* Organization and person URLs could be checked for much more data, including:
  - iCal freebusy file
  - RSS feed (populate to n.n.rss?)
    `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"  href="http://example.net/rss.xml" />`
  - hResume
    - Populate "competence area" tags of person from skills
  - hCard
